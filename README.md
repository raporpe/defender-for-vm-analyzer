# Defender for VM Analyzer

This tool, created by Raúl Portugués del Peño (Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft) analyzes the number of hours a Databricks PaaS VM is running. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the additional cost that would be incurred if Azure Defender for VMs were enabled at the subscription level. Defender for VMs cannot be enabled as of today (2022) in specific VMs: the only option is to enable it at the subscription level, which includes those VMs created by Databricks.
